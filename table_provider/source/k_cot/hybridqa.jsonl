The idea for the Games came around from a 1968 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study on promoting winter tourism in Yugoslavia. After Sarajevo was awarded the 1984 Games in 1978, venue construction and renovation took place between 1979 and 1983. Weather postponed the men's downhill alpine skiing event three times before it was finally run. The men's cross-country skiing 30 km event was run during a blizzard. After the games, all but one of the venues were damaged during the Bosnian War and the Siege of Sarajevo. After the war, Zetra Ice Hall was rebuilt and is in use as of 2010.passages: \n\n\nThe table has 9 rows and 3 columns \n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Venue</th>\n      <th>Sports</th>\n      <th>Capacity</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Bjela\u0161nica</td>\n      <td>Alpine skiing ( men )</td>\n      <td>Not listed</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Igman , Malo Polje</td>\n      <td>Nordic combined ( ski jumping ) , Ski jumping</td>\n      <td>Not listed</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Igman , Veliko Polje</td>\n      <td>Biathlon , Cross-country skiing , Nordic combined ( Cross-country skiing )</td>\n      <td>Not listed</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Jahorina</td>\n      <td>Alpine skiing ( women )</td>\n      <td>Not listed</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Ko\u0161evo Stadium</td>\n      <td>Opening ceremonies</td>\n      <td>50,000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>Skenderija II Hall</td>\n      <td>Ice hockey</td>\n      <td>15,000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>Trebevi\u0107 Bobsleigh and Luge Track</td>\n      <td>Bobsleigh , Luge</td>\n      <td>4,000 ( luge ) 7,500 ( bobsleigh )</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>Zetra Ice Hall</td>\n      <td>Closing ceremonies , Figure skating , Ice hockey ( final )</td>\n      <td>15,000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>8</th>\n      <td>Zetra Ice Rink</td>\n      <td>Speed skating</td>\n      <td>Not listed</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nQuery: \nWhat is the capacity of the venue that was named in honor of Juan Antonio Samaranch in 2010 after his death ?\nExplanation: The context mentions that after the war, Zetra Ice Hall was rebuilt and is in use as of 2010.
