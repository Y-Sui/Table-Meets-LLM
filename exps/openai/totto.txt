Algebraic logic has five Logical system and Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra which includes Physics algebra and Nodal algebra (provide models of propositional modal logics).
<context>
In mathematical logic, algebraic logic is the reasoning obtained by manipulating equations with free variables.|In mathematical logic, the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra (or Lindenbaum algebra) of a logical theory T consists of the equivalence classes of sentences of the theory (i.e., the quotient, under the equivalence relation ~ defined such that p ~ q exactly when p and q are provably equivalent in T).|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern algebraic logic.|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the quotient algebra obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this congruence relation.

Algebraic logic has five Logical system and Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra which includes Physics algebra and Nodal algebra (provide models of propositional modal logics).
<context>
In mathematical logic, algebraic logic is the reasoning obtained by manipulating equations with free variables.|In mathematical logic, the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra (or Lindenbaum algebra) of a logical theory T consists of the equivalence classes of sentences of the theory (i.e., the quotient, under the equivalence relation ~ defined such that p ~ q exactly when p and q are provably equivalent in T).|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern algebraic logic.|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the quotient algebra obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this congruence relation.

Algebraic logic has five Logical system and Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra which includes Physics algebra and Nodal algebra (provide models of propositional modal logics).
<context>
In mathematical logic, algebraic logic is the reasoning obtained by manipulating equations with free variables.|In mathematical logic, the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra (or Lindenbaum algebra) of a logical theory T consists of the equivalence classes of sentences of the theory (i.e., the quotient, under the equivalence relation ~ defined such that p ~ q exactly when p and q are provably equivalent in T).|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern algebraic logic.|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the quotient algebra obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this congruence relation.

Algebraic logic has five Logical system and Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra which includes Physics algebra and Nodal algebra (provide models of propositional modal logics).
<context>
In mathematical logic, algebraic logic is the reasoning obtained by manipulating equations with free variables.|In mathematical logic, the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra (or Lindenbaum algebra) of a logical theory T consists of the equivalence classes of sentences of the theory (i.e., the quotient, under the equivalence relation ~ defined such that p ~ q exactly when p and q are provably equivalent in T).|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern algebraic logic.|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the quotient algebra obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this congruence relation.

Algebraic logic has five Logical system and Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra which includes Physics algebra and Nodal algebra (provide models of propositional modal logics).
<context>
In mathematical logic, algebraic logic is the reasoning obtained by manipulating equations with free variables.|In mathematical logic, the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra (or Lindenbaum algebra) of a logical theory T consists of the equivalence classes of sentences of the theory (i.e., the quotient, under the equivalence relation ~ defined such that p ~ q exactly when p and q are provably equivalent in T).|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern algebraic logic.|The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the quotient algebra obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this congruence relation.

The driver who finished in position 4 in the 2004 United States Grand Prix was of what nationality ?
<context>
2004 United States Grand Prix | Classification -- Qualifying |  | The 2004 United States Grand Prix, officially the XXXIII Foster's United States Grand Prix, was a Formula One motor race held on June 20, 2004 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was the ninth round of the 2004 Formula One season. Rubens Barrichello started from pole position in his Ferrari ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. However, following a start-line incident between five cars, four of whom retired as a result, Schumacher overtook Barrichello on the safety car restart on lap six, and despite a threat from Barrichello after the final pit stops, Schumacher held on to take his eighth win of the season. Takuma Sato became only the second Japanese driver to achieve a podium finish. The race saw two serious accidents caused by Michelin tyre failures in what would be a precedent for the 2005 United States Grand Prix, at which all Michelin-shod cars withdrew over safety concerns. First, Fernando Alonso's Renault speared off the track at the end of the pit straight on lap nine. Later, Ralf Schumacher's Williams suffered the same fate, but in the most dangerous part of the track, causing him to hit the wall at a ninety-degree angle rearwards. The impact left Schumacher with spinal fractures and concussion, which prevented him from racing until the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix, three months later.

List of best-selling books | List of best-selling individual books -- Between 10 million and 20 million copies |  | This page provides lists of best-selling individual books and book series to date and in any language. Best selling refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources. This list is incomplete because there are many books, such as The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, or A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, that are commonly cited as best-selling books yet have no reliable sales figures. Similarly, many notable book series that sold very widely are poorly documented (Land of Oz) or consist of multiple sub-series (Tom Swift). According to Guinness World Records as of 1995, the Bible is the best-selling book of all time, with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed. The Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, also known as the Little Red Book, has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures - with estimates ranging from 800 million to over 6.5 billion printed volumes, with some claiming the distribution ran into the billions and some citing over a billion official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations. Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of books may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the below lists of best-selling books for these reasons. Having sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.

Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics |  |  | Brazil competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's nineteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics, excluding the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The Brazilian Olympic Committee (Portuguese: Comitê Olímpico Brasileiro, COB) sent the nation's largest ever delegation in history to the Games. A total of 243 athletes, 124 men and 119 women, competed in 24 sports. Brazil left Athens with a total of 10 medals (5 golds, 2 silver, and 3 bronze), the lowest in Summer Olympics since 1992. Although the nation's final medal count could not surpass its previous records set in Atlanta (15 medals) and Sydney (12 medals), Brazil produced a record of five golds at these edition, a performance only surpassed 12 years later in Rio de Janeiro, when Brazil was the host country and won seven gold medals. Until the Athens 2004 Games, Brazil had only a two-time Olympic champion, the legendary Adhemar Ferreira da Silva, who shone on the triple jump in Helsinki-1952 and Melbourne-1956. That changed when sailor Robert Scheidt shone in the Laser class and secured his second gold medal (he had already been champion in Atlanta-1996). Also in the sailing, Torben Grael and Marcelo Ferreira reached gold in the Star class. Both became two-time Olympic champions since they had won in Atlanta-1996. With the achievement, Torben Grael wrote his name in history (at the time) as the greatest Olympic athlete in Brazil at all times, with five medals ( a performance also matched by Robert Scheidt 8 years later ). He is also one of the sailors with the largest number of Olympic medals at all times, along with Robert Scheidt and British Ben Ainslie.

Australia at the Winter Olympics | Results -- Medalists |  | Australia first competed in the Winter Olympic Games in 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and has participated in every games since, with the exception of the 1948 Games in St. Moritz. In the early years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes placed in the top half of their events before 1976, while the vast majority placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, as well as the lack of support for the athletes - sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile. After the appointment of Geoff Henke - who had been unable to compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application - as team manager in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians were regarded as medal prospects. The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports, the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria. Australia won its first medal, a bronze, in 1994 in the men's 5,000 metres short track relay speed skating event. Zali Steggall gained Australia's first individual medal in 1998, when she won bronze in the slalom event. In 2002, Steven Bradbury won the 1,000 metres short track speed skating and Alisa Camplin won the aerials event, making Australia the only southern hemisphere country to have won a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. Australia sent 40 competitors to compete in 10 sports at the 2006 Games in Turin. Their goal of winning a medal was achieved when Dale Begg-Smith won the gold in men's freestyle moguls skiing. Camplin claimed her second medal, a bronze in the aerials event. At the 2010 Games in Vancouver Australia had its most successful Winter Olympics taking home two gold and one silver medal.

It has been running continually since 1987-88. The champions are promoted to the Tribute Cornwall/Devon league, and the runner-up plays the second team in Tribute Devon 1, with the winning team gaining promotion. One or two teams are usually relegated to Tribute Cornwall 2. Saltash are the most successful team having won the league on five occasions and have been runner-up three times; they currently play in Tribute Cornwall/Devon. From the 2016-17 season Cornwall 1 and Cornwall 2 were amalgamated to create the Tribute Cornwall League with fifteen teams playing each other once in a first phase. After Christmas the teams split into two leagues with the top eight playing in Cornwall One and the remainder playing in Cornwall Two. Hayle won both phase one and phase two, winning the title with two matches to play. They are promoted to the Cornwall/Devon league, following their relegation from that league in 2015-16. Newquay Hornets finished in second place and were due to play their counterparts from Devon, Torrington for the second promotion spot. Newquay did not want promotion and declined to play the match. For the 2018-19 season Cornwall 1 and Cornwall 2 would revert to being two separate divisions.

List of highest-grossing Indian films | Highest-grossing films by language -- Gujarati | The Gujarati cinema produces films in Gujarati language and is primarily focused on the audience in Gujarat and Mumbai . The film industry is sometimes referred to as Dhollywood or Gollywood . | This is a ranking of the highest grossing Indian films which includes films from various languages based on the conservative global box office estimates as reported by reputable sources. There is no official tracking of domestic box office figures within India, and Indian sites publishing data are frequently pressured to increase their domestic box office estimates. Indian films have been screened in markets around the world since the early 20th century. As of 2003, there are markets in over 90 countries where films from India are screened. During the first decade of the 21st century, there was a steady rise in the ticket price, a tripling in the number of theaters and an increase in the number of prints of a film being released, which led to a large increase in the box office collections. The majority of highest-grossing Indian films are Bollywood (Hindi) films. As of 2014, Bollywood represents 43% of the net box office revenue in India, while Tamil and Telugu cinema represent 36%, and other regional industries constitute 21%.

Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male | Recipients | 1982 award winner Al Jarreau Two-time award winner Mel Tormé Two-time award winner Harry Connick , Jr . | The Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to male recording artists for quality jazz vocal performances (songs or albums). Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position. Prior to 1981, the gender-neutral category of Best Jazz Vocal Performance existed. The first award specifically for male performances was presented to George Benson in 1981 for the song Moody's Mood. The category remained unchanged until 1985, when it was combined with the award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female and presented in the genderless category. Gender-specific awards were once again presented from 1986 until 1991. In 1992, the two categories were combined and presented as the category Best Jazz Vocal Performance. This category was later renamed to Best Jazz Vocal Album beginning in 2001. While the gender-specific award has not been presented since the category merge in 1992, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced. Bobby McFerrin holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of four consecutive wins from 1986 to 1989 (once along with Jon Hendricks). Mel Tormé and Harry Connick, Jr. each received the award twice. An American artist received the award each year it was presented.

<context>
List of Taiwanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film | Submissions | The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956 . [ 4 ] The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films . Following this , they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award . [ 3 ] Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Taiwan for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony . | The Republic of China (Taiwan) has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since 1957, and regularly since 1980. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since. For the purposes of Oscar submissions, AMPAS recognizes Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate entities, and each one regularly submits a film to the competition. Taiwan became the first of the three ethnic Chinese entities to enter the competition in 1957. To date, Taiwan has submitted forty-five films for Oscar consideration. Three Taiwanese films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and all three nominated films were directed by Ang Lee: The Wedding Banquet, Eat Drink Man Woman, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which is the only Taiwanese film to have won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Taiwan initially selected Ang Lee's Lust, Caution in 2007, but AMPAS did not accept the film saying that was not a majority-Taiwanese production. Directors Chen Kunhou and Hou Hsiao-hsien have each had three films selected to represent Taiwan, but none received an Oscar nomination.

The 16th largest private university in the nation, Drexel is made up of nine colleges and four schools, most of which serve both undergraduate and graduate students. It offers 96 undergraduate degree programs, 88 master's programs, and 35 doctoral programs. Drexel was founded as a technical school in 1891 for the improvement of industrial education as a means of opening better and wider avenues of employment to young men and women. Drexel began awarding undergraduate degrees in 1914, starting with the Bachelor of Science in engineering; before that, Drexel granted certificates or diplomas in the field of enrollment. In 1931, Drexel began offering graduate degrees through the School of Home Economics. Since its founding the university has graduated over 100,000 alumni. Certificate-earning alumni such as artist Violet Oakley and illustrator Frank Schoonover reflect the early emphasis on art as part of the university's curriculum. With World War II, the university's technical programs swelled, and as a result Drexel graduated alumni such as Paul Baran, one of the founding fathers of the Internet and one of the inventors of the packet switching network, and Norman Joseph Woodland the inventor of barcode technology. In addition to its emphasis on technology Drexel has graduated several notable athletes such as National Basketball Association (NBA) basketball players Michael Anderson and Malik Rose, and several notable business people such as Raj Gupta, former President and Chief executive officer (CEO) of Rohm and Haas, and Kenneth C. Dahlberg, former CEO of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).

Param Vir Chakra | Recipients | The three living recipients of the Param Vir Chakra : Yogendra Singh Yadav , Bana Singh , and Sanjay Kumar The PVC has been awarded 21 times , of which 14 were awarded posthumously and 16 arose from actions in Indo-Pakistani conflicts . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Of the 21 awardees , 20 have been from the Indian Army , and one has been from the Indian Air Force . The Grenadiers , with three awards , have received the greatest number of Param Vir Chakras . The various Gorkha Rifle regiments of the Indian Army have received three awards , with the 1 , 8 , and 11 Gorkha Rifle regiments each having one PVC recipient . [ 22 ] As of January 2018 [ update ] , Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon , who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra posthumously in 1971 , is the only Indian Air Force officer to have been honoured with the medal . [ 5 ] [ 22 ] Subedar Major Bana Singh , Subedar Sanjay Kumar and Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav , are the only living recipients of the award . [ 21 ] ** Rank refers to rank held at time of award . | The Param Vir Chakra (PVC) is India's highest military decoration, awarded for displaying distinguished acts of valour during wartime. Param Vir Chakra translates as the Wheel of the Ultimate Brave, and the award is granted for most conspicuous bravery in the presence of the enemy. The medal of the PVC was designed by Savitri Khanolkar, whose daughter's brother-in-law, Major Somnath Sharma, was coincidentally awarded the first PVC. As of January 2018[update], the medal has been awarded 21 times, of which 14 were posthumous and 16 arose from actions in Indo-Pakistani conflicts. Of the 21 awardees, 20 have been from the Indian Army, and one has been from the Indian Air Force. A number of central and state governments and ministries of India provide allowances and rewards to recipients of the PVC (or their family members in case of the recipient's death). Only 21 military personnel have received this award to date. The history of present-day Indian gallantry awards can be traced back to the rule of the East India Company, when the first formal award was instituted by Lord William Bentinck in 1834 as the Order of Merit, later renamed the Indian Order of Merit in 1902. During the First World War, the British awards system was adopted and continued through the Second World War. Post-independence, new awards were instituted on 26 January 1950, with retroactive effect from 15 August 1947. The PVC is equivalent to the Medal of Honor in the United States and the Victoria Cross in the United Kingdom.

List of places of worship in Worthing | Open places of worship |  | The borough of Worthing, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex, has 49 extant, operating churches and other places of worship. Sixteen other former places of worship are still in existence but are no longer in religious use. The district, on the south coast of England, is mostly urban: it consists of the seaside resort of Worthing, established in the 19th century, and its residential suburbs, ranging from ancient villages absorbed by the growing town to housing estates built after World War II. Most residents identify themselves as Christian, and there is only one non-Christian place of worship, a mosque. The Church of England, the country's officially established church, is represented by more churches than any other denomination, but Worthing's first church was an Independent chapel. Protestant Nonconformism flourished in the early 19th century during the town's early development, while Roman Catholic worship (after the Catholic Emancipation) took root somewhat later. English Heritage has awarded listed status to 12 of Worthing's extant churches and two former church buildings. A building is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II* is used for particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of special interest.

The vast majority of those belong to the Austronesian peoples. Based on ethnic classification, the largest ethnic group in Indonesia is the Javanese who make up about 40% of the total population. The Javanese are concentrated on the island of Java but millions have migrated to other islands throughout the archipelago because of the transmigration program. The Sundanese, Batak, Madurese, Minangkabau, and Buginese are the next largest groups in the country. Many ethnic groups, particularly in Kalimantan and Papua, have only hundreds of members. Most of the local languages belong to the Austronesian language family, although a significant number of people, particularly in eastern Indonesia, speak unrelated Papuan languages. Chinese Indonesians make up a little less than 1% of the total Indonesian population according to the 2000 census. Some of these Indonesians of Chinese descent speak various Chinese dialects, most notably Hokkien and Hakka. The classification of ethnic groups in Indonesia is not rigid and in some cases unclear due to migrations, cultural and linguistic influences; for example some may consider Bantenese and Cirebonese to be members of the Javanese people; however, some others argue that they are different ethnic groups altogether since they have their own distinct dialects. This is the same case with Baduy people that share many cultural similarities with the Sundanese people. An example of hybrid ethnicity is the Betawi people, descended not only from marriages between different peoples in Indonesia but also with Arab, Chinese and Indian migrants since the era of colonial Batavia (Jakarta).

Tourism in Croatia | Tourist regions -- Attractions | The United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) has included the following Croatian sites on its World Heritage List : | Tourism is a major industry in Croatia. In 2018, Croatia had 19.7 million tourist visitors who made 110.275 million overnight stays. The history of tourism in Croatia dates back to the middle of the 19th century in the period around 1850. It has been developing successfully ever since. Today, Croatia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the Mediterranean. Tourism in Croatia is concentrated in the areas along the Adriatic coast and is strongly seasonal, peaking in July and August. Eight areas in the country have been designated national parks, and the landscape in these areas is afforded extra protection from development. Currently, there are ten sites in Croatia inscribed on the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites and 15 sites on the tentative list. Lonely Planet named Croatia as the top pick destination for 2005, while National Geographic Adventure Magazine named Croatia as Destination of the Year in 2006.

What is the name of the area where the station with a UHF of 45- is located ?
<context>
Preseli transmitting station | Transmissions -- Analogue and digital television | This was the initial roll-out for digital television using the DVB-T system . The transmitter frequencies and power outputs were chosen not to interfere with the UHF TV channels , but to be received with the same aerial-group . The QAM constellations and number of carriers were changed around 2002 after the collapse of ITV Digital as the service was taken over by the Freeview consortium . | The Preseli transmitting station (formerly spelt Presely) is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility, situated close to the village of Crymych, in Pembrokeshire, Wales (grid reference SN172306). It is owned and operated by Arqiva. It has a 235.4-metre (772 ft) high guyed steel lattice mast. It was constructed in 1962 by the IBA to transmit ITV 405-line television with transmissions commencing on Band III channel 8 from antennas at 559 m (1,835 ft) above sea level. The triangle of antenna arrays aimed beams of signal towards Pembrokeshire, another lobe was directed towards western Carmarthenshire and a northward beam covered south western Cardiganshire. The northward beam from the site also fed the transmitter at Arfon in North Wales. The Welsh region ITV programming was initially provided by Teledu Cymru which was taken over by TWW in 1964, and eventually HTV Wales who took over from 1968. In 1971, three protesters from Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg were jailed for conspiring to trespass after gaining access to the site compound and climbing the lower section of the mast. This was part of a series of protests in Wales aiming to get a dedicated Welsh-language TV channel established. The campaign was eventually considered to have been mostly successful with the establishment of S4C (Sianel 4 Cymru) eleven years later. The site was uprated in 1973 to transmit UHF 625-line PAL analogue television channels, starting with BBC1, BBC2 and HTV Wales, with S4C being added in late 1982. The VHF channel 8 transmissions were discontinued in January 1985 as 405-line TV in the UK was phased out.

<context>
WHA General Player Draft | Regular rounds -- Calgary Broncos |  | The World Hockey Association General Player Draft was held over the course of two days, February 12 and February 13, 1972, in Anaheim, California. The purpose of the draft was to establish an orderly process through which WHA teams would stock their rosters by the beginning of their inaugural season later that year. As such, players from other professional teams (notably National Hockey League clubs) were eligible to be drafted. The draftees were not under any legal obligation to sign with the drafting WHA club: other WHA clubs were prevented from negotiating with the players who had been drafted. The draft was held in two parts: a Preliminary round in which teams made so-called priority selections, and the rounds of the General Draft which followed. For the Preliminary round, each team wrote four names on a piece of paper, which were then submitted and announced prior to the start of the General Draft. The priority selections were the most sought after players, consisting mostly of NHL veterans and highly touted prospects. Twelve teams took part in the draft: the Calgary Broncos, Chicago Cougars, Dayton Aeros, Edmonton Oil Kings, Los Angeles Sharks, Miami Screaming Eagles, Minnesota Fighting Saints, New England Whalers, Winnipeg Jets, and three then-unnamed franchises based in New York (later the Raiders), Ontario (later the Ottawa Nationals) and Quebec City (later the Nordiques). The Broncos folded within months, before the beginning of the season, and the negotiating rights to their picks were transferred to a new club: the Cleveland Crusaders. Similarly the Screaming Eagles never took to the ice, and their picks transferred to the Philadelphia Blazers. The Dayton Aeros moved to Houston before the playing season, and the Oil Kings changed their name to Alberta Oilers with the intent of splitting home games between Edmonton and Calgary.

Both the U.S. space program and Soviet space program were operated using mainly military pilots as astronauts. During this period, no commercial space launches were available to private operators, and no private organization was able to offer space launches. In the 1980s, the European Space Agency created Arianespace, the world's first commercial space transportation company, and, following the Challenger disaster, the American government deregulated the American space transportation market as well. In the 1990s the Russian government sold their majority stake in RSC Energia to private investors (although it has recently renationalized the Russian space sector in 2013-2014.) These events for the first time allowed private organizations to purchase, develop and offer space launch services; beginning the period of private spaceflight in the late-1980s and early-1990s.

At which air force base did the pilot who graduated in 1968 serve ?
<context>
List of United States Air Force Academy alumni |  |  | The United States Air Force Academy is an undergraduate college in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with the mission of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Air Force. The Academy was established in 1954, entered its first class in 1955, and graduated its first class in 1959. All students hold the Air Force rank of Cadet. Sports media refer to the Academy as Air Force; this usage is officially endorsed. Most cadets are admitted through a congressional appointment system. The curriculum is broad-based but has traditionally emphasized science and engineering. Before the Academy's first graduating class in 1959, the United States Military Academy and United States Naval Academy were the primary sources of officers for the Air Force and its predecessors, the Army Air Corps and Army Air Forces. [citation needed] Though the primary focus of the Academy is for the Air Force, some graduates are given the option of cross-commissioning into the United States Army, United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, or United States Coast Guard. This list is drawn from graduates, non-graduate former cadets, current cadets, and faculty of the Air Force Academy. Over 410 noted scholars from a variety of academic fields are Academy graduates, including: 41 Rhodes Scholars, 9 Marshall Scholars, 13 Harry S. Truman Scholars, 115 John F. Kennedy School of Government Scholars, and 31 Gerahart Scholars. Additional notable graduates include 403 general officers, 164 graduates who were killed in combat, 36 repatriated prisoners of war, 1 Medal of Honor recipient, and 2 combat aces. Thirty-nine Academy graduates have become astronauts, second among institutions of higher learning only to the United States Naval Academy with 52.

Eastern Kentucky Coalfield | Geography -- Major cities | Ashland , the region 's largest city The following list consists of Eastern Kentucky cities with populations over 4,000 according to the U.S. Census estimates released in 2016 : [ 9 ] | The Eastern Kentucky Coalfield is part of the Central Appalachian bituminous coalfield, including all or parts of 30 Kentucky counties and adjoining areas in Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee. It covers an area from the Allegheny Mountains in the east across the Cumberland Plateau to the Pottsville Escarpment in the west. The region is known for its coal mining; most family farms in the region have disappeared since the introduction of surface mining in the 1940s and 1950s. The Daniel Boone National Forest is located on rough but beautiful terrain along and east of the Pottsville Escarpment. There are many natural arches and sandstone cliffs that are excellent for rock climbing and rappeling. The Red River Gorge, part of the National Forest, is known worldwide in rock climbing circles. The Sheltowee Trace Trail runs 420-430 km (260-270 mi) north and south, through the region. During the American Civil War most of this region leaned toward the Union due to its makeup at the time of mostly small farmers, but more than 2,000 men from this area formed the 5th. Kentucky Vol. Inf., known as the Army of Eastern Kentucky, under Gen. Humphrey Marshall, C.S.A. During the Great Depression, New Deal programs and the organizing of the United Mine Workers of America made many of the eastern counties Democratic. Eastern Kentucky has a rich musical heritage.

Between the 1983 and 1984 athlete , which one is younger ?
<context>
Triple jump | Men |  | The triple jump, sometimes referred to as the hop, step and jump or the hop, skip and jump, is a track and field event, similar to the long jump. As a group, the two events are referred to as the horizontal jumps. The competitor runs down the track and performs a hop, a bound and then a jump into the sand pit. The triple jump was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympics event since the Games' inception in 1896. According to IAAF rules, the hop shall be made so that an athlete lands first on the same foot
as that from which he has taken off; in the step he shall land on the
other foot, from which, subsequently, the jump is performed. The current male and female world record holders are Jonathan Edwards, with a jump of 18.29 m (60 ft 0.08 in), and Inessa Kravets of Ukraine, with a jump of 15.50 m (50 ft 10.24 in). Both records were set during 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg.

<context>
1993 NBA draft | Notable undrafted players | These players were not selected in the 1993 NBA draft but have played at least one game in the NBA . | The 1993 NBA draft took place on June 30, 1993, in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The draft had some talented players at the top, but injuries and personal problems hurt many of them. Anfernee Hardaway, Allan Houston, and Jamal Mashburn all looked like possible Hall of Famers until their careers were cut short by injuries. Isaiah Rider and Vin Baker showed great potential but were plagued by personal problems. Bobby Hurley's career was derailed by a car accident in December of his rookie year. The mid-to-late first round (starting with pick 13) was littered with players that failed to make any significant impact, with the exception of three-time NBA champion Sam Cassell. One of the NBA best all-time wing defensive players, three-time champion Bruce Bowen, went un-drafted. Despite having the lowest odds, the Orlando Magic won the first pick in the 1993 NBA Draft Lottery. It was the second year in a row the Magic won the draft lottery. The Magic drafted Chris Webber with the number one overall pick, but only minutes later, executed a blockbuster trade. The Magic traded Webber to the Golden State Warriors for their first round pick (#3 overall) Penny Hardaway and three of Golden State's future first-round draft selections.

<context>
Australia at the 1968 Summer Paralympics |  |  | Australia competed at the 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv, Israel. The Games significantly expanded in 1968 when compared to previous years, as did the Australian team and the events included in the Games. Mexico City were originally to host the 1968 Paralympics, however, they were moved to Tel Aviv in Israel. Although there was disappointment expressed at not being able to have to Paralympics in the 'Olympic' city of that year, the Tel Aviv organising committee worked hard to provide a positive experience for the athletes and their support staff. The Australian team however had to be content with dubious living conditions for the duration of the competition, being housed in an underground car park. Despite the poor accommodation the athletes performed well, with world records falling and numerous Australian competitors taking home a swag of gold medals (see 'Medalists' table below). Australian's haul of 38 medals earned them fourth spot on the 'unofficial' placing.

In what year did the 1999 Turner Prize winner win the Academy Award for his film , 12 Years a Slave ?
<context>
List of Turner Prize winners and nominees | Winners and shortlisted artists |  | The Turner Prize is an annual prize presented to a British visual artist, organised by the Tate Gallery. Named after the painter J. M. W. Turner, it was first presented in 1984, and is one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious, but controversial, art awards. Initially, the prize was awarded to the individual who had made the greatest contribution to art in Britain in the previous twelve months, but it now celebrates a British artist under fifty for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the twelve months preceding. The winner is chosen by a panel of four independent judges invited by the Tate and chaired by the director of Tate Britain. The prize is accompanied by a monetary award of £25,000, although the amount has varied depending on the sponsor. For example, between 2004 and 2007, while sponsored by Gordon's, the total prize fund was £40,000; £25,000 was awarded to the winner and £5,000 to the losing nominees. A shortlist of finalists is drawn up and usually published about six months before the prize is awarded in November or December each year, although shortlists were not made public in 1988 and 1990; in 1989, a list of seven commended artists was published. Controversy surrounded the presentation of the inaugural prize to Malcolm Morley as some critics questioned his relevance to art in Britain; he had lived and worked in the United States for the previous 20 years. Since its inception, the prize itself has received considerable criticism. In 2002, after Culture Minister Kim Howells described the Turner Prize as conceptual bullshit, Prince Charles wrote a letter of support to him, stating It has contaminated the art establishment for so long. Since 2000, the Stuckists art group have protested against the prize; in 2008, they gave out leaflets with the message The Turner Prize is Crap, to protest at the lack of figurative paintings amongst the nominees' exhibitions. Considerable media pressure is applied to nominees and winners of the Turner Prize.

Who attempted revive the team with the least amount of losses ?
<context>
List of winless seasons | Rugby league -- Great Britain | In the Rugby Football League Championship , teams initially played a variable number of games , with the maximum ranging over time from 26 to 38 , and some teams playing as few as fourteen . In more modern times the fixture list has been standardised at 26 games per team . As a result of this fairly lengthy schedule , it has been almost impossible for British rugby league teams to lose all their games , with the only exception being during World War II 's so-called `` Wartime emergency League '' when teams were often able to arrange no more than ten games and some as few as five . The only four winless seasons since normal competition resumed after the war have been in the second and third divisions of the Championship . In 2018 , West Wales Raiders set a number of Rugby League records for futility on course to losing all 26 games , including the largest point differential ( -1930 points ) , most points conceded ( 2106 ) and largest average number of points conceded per game ( 81 ) . In addition , they were on the receiving end of Rugby League 's largest ever defeat - a 144-0 loss to York City Knights . | A winless season is a regular season in which a sports team fails to win any of its games. The antithesis of a perfect season, this ignominy has been suffered twelve times in professional American football, six times in arena football, three times in professional Canadian football, once each in American professional lacrosse and box lacrosse, more than twenty-five times in major Australian football leagues, over twenty times in top-level rugby league, at least twice in top-level rugby union, and twice in English county cricket.

Which beer company owned the MLB team that went less than 28 but more than 21 seasons not winning a pennant ?
<context>
List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts | Major League pennant droughts -- Longest current Major League pennant droughts | No pennants were won in 1994 due to the players ' strike that year . | Throughout the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), franchises have had various postseason and World Series droughts. All 16 of the original Major League franchises (i.e., those in place when the first World Series was played in 1903) have won the World Series, with the longest wait for a franchise's first championship being for the Phillies (77 years, ending in 1980). Since expansion began in 1961, six of the 14 expansion teams have never won the World Series. Further, one franchise (the Indians) has a current championship drought that pre-dates the expansion era. The three longest championship droughts in history were ended recently by the Red Sox (85 years, ending in 2004), the White Sox (87 years, ending in 2005), and the Cubs (107 years, ending in 2016). Only one expansion franchise (the Mariners) has never won a pennant (i.e., the league championship, the two winners of which meet in the World Series). The three longest pennant droughts in history were recently ended by the Nationals (51 years, starting with the team's foundation and ending in 2019, and including the franchise's entire 36 years as the Montreal Expos), the Rangers (49 years, starting with the team's foundation and ending in 2010) and the Cubs (70 years, ending in 2016). As the Nationals are the third franchise to be based in the city of Washington, their 2019 pennant also ended a drought of 53 seasons played in Washington since their last pennant, which was in 1933 (here we discount the 33 seasons during which there was no team in Washington). Every MLB franchise has at least been to the postseason, especially since expansion of the playoffs in 1994 made that feat easier. The Mariners have the longest active postseason drought at 18 years. Long postseason droughts were ended recently by the Nationals (30 years for the franchise, 45 seasons over 78 years for the city, ending in 2012), the Pirates (20 years, ending in 2013), the Royals (28 years, ending in 2014), and the Blue Jays (21 years, ending in 2015). This list includes only the modern World Series between the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), not the various 19th-century championship series.

What is the name of the historic African Methodist Episcopal church that was built on land donated by Miss Margaret Collingsworth ?
<context>
List of Methodist churches in the United States | Selected salient ones -- Louisiana |  | This is a list of Methodist churches in the United States. It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense). It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings. This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard. Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain. In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray. The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings. In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches.

John Parrott | Career finals -- Ranking finals : 18 ( 9 titles , 9 runners-up ) | Legend World Championship ( 1–1 ) UK Championship ( 1–1 ) Other ( 7–7 ) | John Stephen Parrott, MBE (born 11 May 1964) is an English former professional snooker player, and television personality. He was a familiar face on the professional snooker circuit during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, and remained within the top 16 of the world rankings for fourteen consecutive seasons. He reached the final of the 1989 World Championship, where he lost 3-18 to Steve Davis, the heaviest defeat in a world championship final in modern times. He won the title two years later, defeating Jimmy White in the final of the 1991 World Championship. He repeated his win against White later the same year, to take the 1991 UK Championship title, becoming only the third player to win both championships in the same calendar year (after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry); he is still one of only six players to have achieved this feat. He spent three seasons at number 2 in the world rankings (1989/1990, 1992/1993, 1993/1994), and he is one of several players to have achieved more than 200 competitive centuries during his career, with 221.

List of the busiest airports in Canada | 2016 -- Canada 's 20 busiest airports by aircraft movements |  | The following is a list of the busiest airports in Canada. The airports are ranked by passenger traffic and aircraft movements. For each airport, the lists cite the city served by the airport as designated by Transport Canada, not necessarily the municipality where the airport is physically located. Since 2010, Toronto-Pearson and Vancouver International have been the two busiest airports by both passengers served and aircraft movements. Toronto-Pearson's location within the most populous metropolitan region of Canada solidifies its top spot amongst all of Canada's airports, serving more passengers and having more aircraft movements than the top two other airports combined. Given its advantageous position on the west coast of Canada, Vancouver International has long served as Canada's hub for flights bound for Asia and Oceania.

Ronnie O'Sullivan |  | Legend World Championship ( 5–1 ) UK Championship ( 7–1 ) Other ( 24–14 ) | Ronald Antonio O'Sullivan OBE (born 5 December 1975) is an English professional snooker player who is one of the most successful players in the history of the sport. Since turning professional in 1992, he has won five World Championships, a record seven Masters titles, and a record seven UK Championships, setting a record total of 19 titles in Triple Crown tournaments. He shares the record for the most ranking titles (36) with Stephen Hendry and also holds the record as the youngest winner of a ranking title (1993 UK Championship, aged 17 years and 358 days) as well as the youngest winner of the Masters (in 1995, aged 19 years and 69 days). In the 2017/2018 season, O'Sullivan won five ranking events in a single season, a record that he shares with Hendry, Ding Junhui and Mark Selby. His career prize money of over £11 million is the highest amount earned by any player in snooker history. A prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan is the only player to have reached 1,000 career century breaks. He has also achieved the highest number of officially recognized maximum breaks in professional competition (15), and the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds at the 1997 World Championship. He first became world number one in the 2002/2003 season and held the position for five out of eight seasons, ending in May 2010. He regained the top ranking in March 2019 after a nine-year absence, the longest time any player has spent between spells as world number one, and held it until August 2019. O'Sullivan has often been a controversial figure in the sport. Noted for his unpredictable temperament and his struggles with alcohol, drugs, and depression, he has received many warnings and sanctions from the sport's governing body over his conduct and comments. He took a prolonged break from the sport during the 2012/2013 season and is known for repeatedly declaring his intention to retire.

What are the points of the player who won the 2012 NRL Grand Final with Melbourne ?
<context>
England national rugby league team | Records -- Top points scorers | Kevin Sinfield is England 's top points scorer | The England national rugby league team represents England in international rugby league. The team, largely formed from the Great Britain team which also represented Wales, Scotland and Ireland, is run under the auspices of the Rugby Football League. It participates in the Rugby League World Cup, Four Nations and Test matches. The team dates to 1904, when they played against a mixture of Welsh and Scottish players in Wigan. Until the 1950s, they regularly toured Australia and New Zealand and played both home and away matches against neighbours Wales and France, but when it was decided that Great Britain would tour the Southern Hemisphere instead of England, France and Wales became the only regular opponents. Their first appearance in the Rugby League World Cup was in 1975. They have been three times runners-up; in 1975, 1995 and 2017. England also competed in the European Nations Cup, and, in 2006, an England 'A' team competed for the Federation Shield. England's main rivals historically were Wales and France, with the rivalries stretching back to 1908 and 1934 respectively. England's main rivals now are Australia and New Zealand. Traditionally a predominantly white kit is worn including white shorts and socks. However the jersey usually features some form of red, like red stripes, crosses or chevrons.

List of U.S. cities with significant Chinese-American populations | Metropolitan areas with more than 20,000 Chinese-Americans | The list of metropolitan area with at least the total Chinese-American population of 20,000 , as of the 2011-2015 American Community Survey [ update ] . | Cities considered to have significant Chinese-American populations are large U.S. cities or municipalities with a critical mass of at least 1% of the total urban population; medium-sized cities with a critical mass of at least 1% of their total population; and small cities with a critical mass of at least 10% of the total population. According to the 2012 Census estimates, the three metropolitan areas with the largest Chinese-American populations were the Greater New York Combined Statistical Area at 735,019 people, the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland Combined Statistical Area at 629,243 people, and the Greater Los Angeles Combined Statistical Area at about 566,968 people. In the post-1965 era, first- and second-generation immigrants include those from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Also included in the Chinese-American population enumeration are ethnic Chinese from Malaysia and Vietnam who might identify themselves as Chinese, thus skewing the census reporting. New York City is home to by far the highest Chinese-American population of any city proper, with an estimated 573,388 Chinese-Americans in New York City, significantly higher than the total of the next five cities combined; multiple large Chinatowns in Manhattan, Brooklyn (three), and Queens (three) are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, as large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York, with the largest metropolitan Chinese population outside Asia. The Los Angeles County city of Monterey Park has the highest percentage of Chinese-Americans of any municipality, at 43.7% of its population, or 24,758 people. The San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County is the single largest concentration of combined Chinese and Taiwanese Americans in the country, having a collections of U.S. suburbs with large foreign-born Chinese-speaking populations, ranging from working-class individuals residing in Rosemead and El Monte to wealthier immigrants living in Arcadia, San Marino, and Diamond Bar. A similar demographic shift has also taken place in the southern half of the San Francisco Bay Area. Conversely, the suburbs of New York City within the state of New Jersey are notable for their widespread and increasing prevalence of Chinese-Americans (see list below), reflecting their general affluence and propensity for professional occupations.

What is the full name of the youngest recipient of the medal ?
<context>
List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II | E |  | This is a list of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II. The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States or an opposing foreign force. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict, the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Soviet invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. The United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time. For actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor. Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from Distinguished Service Crosses during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Douglas Albert Munro was the only serviceman from the United States Coast Guard in United States military history to receive the Medal for his actions during the war. The earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force rather than enemy since the United States was neutral during the events of December 7, 1941.

<context>
List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing | Men -- Super-G |  | Alpine skiing is an Olympic sport, contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, included nordic skiing, but the first alpine skiing events were not held until 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. A combined event was held for both men and women in 1936. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that ski instructors could not compete in 1936 because they were professionals, and the Olympics were meant for amateur athletes. Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete for Germany.

List of Norwegian football champions | Details -- Hovedserien ( 1948–1962 ) |  | The Norwegian football champions (Norwegian: Seriemester i fotball) or Eliteserien champions, are the winners of the highest-level football league in Norway. Norgesserien was competed three times with eleven conferences and play-offs from 1937-38 to 1947-48. It was then replaced by the two-conference Hovedserien, which was replaced by the single-conference 1. divisjon in 1963. The top tier changed its name to the Tippeligaen in 1990, and to the current Eliteserien for 2017 and beyond. The winners of this title are not considered Norwegian football champions, as the title is reserved for the winners of the Norwegian Football Cup. Sixteen clubs from ten cities have won the honor. With 26 titles Rosenborg is the most successful team, including 13 consecutive titles from 1992 through 2004. In the early years, Fredrikstad was highly successful, winning the first two titles and taking nine titles until 1960-61. Viking then took over dominance and rose to become the second-most winning team with their four consecutive titles from 1972 through 1975. The double - winning the league and cup the same season - has occurred fourteen times by six clubs. At the end of the 1937-38 season, Fredrikstad were the first club to be crowned champions in the history of the championship. Rosenborg have won 26 titles, the most of any club.

Who was the third place in the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in which the first place was inducted in the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in the same year ?
<context>
UCI Mountain Bike World Cup | Overall series winners -- Cross-country ( XCO ) |  | The UCI Mountain Bike World Cup is a multi-round mountain bike racing series that is sanctioned by the Union Cycliste Internationale. The first World Cup series - which was composed of cross-country events - was held in 1989. The Downhill World Cup was inaugurated two years later, and the Dual Slalom World Cup was launched in 1998. The dual-slalom format - which involved knock-out heats with two riders on the parallel courses in each heat - evolved into four-cross (with four riders on a single course per heat) in 2002 before being dropped after the 2011 season. Riders win points according to their placing in each event. The reigning series leaders in each class are identified by a special jersey. The UCI Mountain Bike World Cup is broadcast live and globally on Red Bull TV. The replacement world series for 4X World Cup is the 4X Pro Tour and for XCM World Cup is UCI MTB Marathon series.

Which noble families are referenced by the title of the movie parodied by The Gore of the Roses ?
<context>
List of film spoofs in Mad | Film spoofs list -- 1990s |  | This list of film spoofs in Mad includes films spoofed (parodied) by the American comic magazine Mad. Usually, an issue of Mad features a spoof of at least one feature film or television program. The works selected by the staff of Mad are typically from cinema and television in the United States. The authors parody the original titles with puns or other wordplay. Characters are caricatured, and lampooned with joke names. These articles typically cover five pages or more, and are presented as a sequential storyline with caricatures and word balloons. The opening page or two-page splash usually consists of the cast of the show introducing themselves directly to the reader; in some parodies, the writers sometimes attempt to circumvent this convention by presenting the characters without such direct exposition. This approach was also used for Mad's television parodies, and came to be identified with the magazine. The style was widely copied by other humor publications. In 1973, the promotional movie poster for Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye was designed in the introductory manner of a Mad parody, including the rectangular word balloons with self-referential dialogue; for verisimilitude, the poster was written and drawn by Mad regulars Frank Jacobs and Jack Davis. Many parodies end with the abrupt deus ex machina appearance of outside characters or pop culture figures who are similar in nature to the film or TV series being parodied, or who comment satirically on the theme. For example, Dr. Phil arrives to counsel the Desperate Housewives, or the cast of Sex and the City show up as the new hookers on Deadwood.

Big East Men's Basketball Tournament | History | Jeff Green of the Georgetown Hoyas attempts to pass during the 2007 Big East Championship game against the Pitt Panthers . | The Big East Men's Basketball Tournament is the championship tournament of the Big East Conference in men's basketball. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. Since 1983, the tournament has been held in Madison Square Garden, New York City. As such, the tournament is the longest running conference tournament at any one site in all of college basketball. In 2011, Connecticut, led by Kemba Walker, became the first and only team in the Big East Tournament to ever win five games in five consecutive days to win the championship. The 2009 tournament featured a six-overtime game in the quarterfinals between the Connecticut Huskies and the Syracuse Orange, in which Syracuse prevailed, 127-117. The game, the second longest in NCAA history, started on the evening of March 12 and ended nearly four hours later in the early morning of March 13. Only three players have achieved repeat MVP honors: Georgetown's Patrick Ewing (1984-1985), Louisville's Peyton Siva (2012-2013), and Villanovas Josh Hart (2015,2017). As part of the deal in which the original Big East split into the new Big East and the American Athletic Conference, the new Big East retained the rights to the conference tournament. The new Big East extended their contract to host the tournament at Madison Square Garden through the 2025 season.

Which publication 's ranking put the person who finished the qualifying round of the French Grand Prix in 1:13.625 in 2001 at 30th out of all F1 drivers ?
<context>
2001 French Grand Prix | Qualifying -- Qualifying classification |  | The 2001 French Grand Prix (officially the Mobil 1 Grand Prix de France) was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours, Magny-Cours, France on 1 July 2001 before a crowd of 120,717 people. It was the tenth race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 51st running of the event as part of the series. The 72-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after starting from second position. Ralf Schumacher finished second for the Williams team with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Ferrari. Ralf Schumacher led the opening 23 laps before he made his first pit stop and Michael Schumacher assumed the lead after the first round of pit stops. His nearest championship rival David Coulthard of the McLaren outfit served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap 32 for an earlier transgression of speeding at the pit lane exit. Michael Schumacher pulled away from the slower car of Ralf Schumacher who baulked his teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, until his second pit stop on the 44th lap. Montoya led laps 46 to 50 before he ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, who maintained it to take his fifth victory at the French Grand Prix, his sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his career. The result enabled Michael Schumacher to increase his Drivers' Championship lead over Coulthard in second to 31 points. Ralf Schumacher's second-place finish moved him past Barrichello for third. Although he retired from the event, Montoya kept fifth. Ferrari further extended their Constructors' Championship advantage to 52 points over the McLaren team in second.

List of doping cases in athletics | C |  | The use of performance-enhancing drugs (doping) is prohibited within the sport of athletics. Athletes who are found to have used such banned substances, whether through a positive drugs test, the biological passport system, an investigation or public admission, may receive a competition ban for a length of time which reflects the severity of the infraction. Athletes who are found to have banned substances in their possession, or who tamper with or refuse to submit to drug testing can also receive bans from the sport. Competitive bans may also be given to athletes who test positive for prohibited recreational drugs or stimulants with little performance-enhancing effect for competitors in athletics. The sports body responsible for determining which substances are banned in athletics is the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Typically, any athlete who tests positive for banned substances after having served a previous ban receives a lifetime ban from the sport of athletics. Many high-profile sportspeople to receive doping bans have come from the sport of athletics, with significant past cases concerning Ben Johnson, Lance Armstrong, Alberto Contador, Shane Warne, Diego Maradona, Shoaib Akhtar, Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery. Furthermore, a number of athletes who underwent state-sponsored doping programmes in East Germany between the 1960s and 1980s were competitors in athletics, but the quality of the international anti-doping work was so poor that only one East German athlete ever tested positive. Following allegations of state-sponsored doping in Russia, the IAAF suspended the country's athletes from competition, including the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Hungary at the 2012 Summer Olympics |  |  | Hungary competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. Hungarian athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era, except the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles because of the Soviet boycott. The Hungarian Olympic Committee (Hungarian: Magyar Olimpiai Bizottság, MOB) sent the nation's smallest delegation to the Games since 1956. A total of 159 athletes, 97 men and 62 women, competed in 18 sports. Hungary originally left London with a total of 17 medals (8 gold, 4 silver, and 5 bronze), finishing tenth in the overall medal standings. Almost a third of the medals were awarded to the team in sprint canoeing, three in swimming, and two each in judo and wrestling. Three Hungarian athletes, all from sprint canoeing, won more than a single Olympic medal in London. For the first time since 1996, Hungary did not win an Olympic medal in men's water polo. Among the nation's medalists were gymnast Krisztián Berki, who became the fourth Hungarian to claim the title in men's pommel horse after 24 years, and hammer thrower Krisztián Pars, who narrowly missed out on the medal standings in Beijing. Katalin Kovács, who won gold and silver in London, emerged as the greatest Hungarian sprint kayaker in history, with a total of eight Olympic medals. Multiple-time European champion László Cseh, who won bronze in London, became one of the most successful Hungarian swimmers in history, with a total of five Olympic medals. Meanwhile, former Olympic silver medalist Dániel Gyurta, set a world record to win the gold in men's breaststroke swimming.

Valencia | Sport | Mestalla Estadi Ciutat de València Pavelló Municipal Font de Sant Lluís | Valencia (Spanish: [baˈlenθja]), officially València (Valencian: [vaˈlensia]), is the capital of the autonomous community of Valencia and the third-largest city in Spain after Madrid and Barcelona, with around 800,000 inhabitants in the administrative centre. Its urban area extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 1.6 million people. Valencia is Spain's third largest metropolitan area, with a population ranging from 1.7 to 2.5 million depending on how the metropolitan area is defined. The Port of Valencia is the 5th busiest container port in Europe and the busiest container port on the Mediterranean Sea. The city is ranked at Beta-global city in the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Valencia was founded as a Roman colony by the consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus in 138 BC, and called Valentia Edetanorum. In 714 Moroccan and Arab Moors occupied the city, introducing their language, religion and customs; they implemented improved irrigation systems and the cultivation of new crops as well. Valencia was the capital of the Taifa of Valencia. In 1238 the Christian king James I of Aragon conquered the city and divided the land among the nobles who helped him conquer it, as witnessed in the Llibre del Repartiment. He also created a new law for the city, the Furs of Valencia, which were extended to the rest of the Kingdom of Valencia. In the 18th century Philip V of Spain abolished the privileges as punishment to the kingdom of Valencia for aligning with the Habsburg side in the War of the Spanish Succession. Valencia was the capital of Spain when Joseph Bonaparte moved the Court there in the summer of 1812.

Project Runway (season 1) | Contestants | The 12 fashion designers competing in the first season were : | Project Runway Season 1 was the first season of Project Runway, Bravo's reality competition show for fashion designers. The season received critical acclaim including an Emmy nomination for outstanding competitive reality series. Growth in audience popularity was also dramatic from its debut to the season finale, making it a sleeper hit. Project Runway gave Bravo one of its most successful series since Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. The winning designer of the first season was Pennsylvania-based designer Jay McCarroll. As his prize for winning the competition among 12 designers, McCarroll won $100,000, a mentorship with Banana Republic to aid in developing his own fashion label, and a feature of his work in the American edition of ELLE magazine. The winning model of the first season, selected by McCarroll, was Julia Beynon. McCarroll later turned down both the $100,000 and the mentorship with Banana Republic, stating that the prizes came with too much contractual baggage. Austin Scarlett later appeared in Project Runway: All Stars in 2012, where he finished runner-up. Wendy Pepper, in the same year, competed in the second season of the All Stars edition placing 12th out of 13. In 2016, Daniel Franco competed in the fifth season of the All Stars edition, placing 12th out of 13.

List of doping cases in athletics | D |  | The use of performance-enhancing drugs (doping) is prohibited within the sport of athletics. Athletes who are found to have used such banned substances, whether through a positive drugs test, the biological passport system, an investigation or public admission, may receive a competition ban for a length of time which reflects the severity of the infraction. Athletes who are found to have banned substances in their possession, or who tamper with or refuse to submit to drug testing can also receive bans from the sport. Competitive bans may also be given to athletes who test positive for prohibited recreational drugs or stimulants with little performance-enhancing effect for competitors in athletics. The sports body responsible for determining which substances are banned in athletics is the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Typically, any athlete who tests positive for banned substances after having served a previous ban receives a lifetime ban from the sport of athletics. Many high-profile sportspeople to receive doping bans have come from the sport of athletics, with significant past cases concerning Ben Johnson, Lance Armstrong, Alberto Contador, Shane Warne, Diego Maradona, Shoaib Akhtar, Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery. Furthermore, a number of athletes who underwent state-sponsored doping programmes in East Germany between the 1960s and 1980s were competitors in athletics, but the quality of the international anti-doping work was so poor that only one East German athlete ever tested positive. Following allegations of state-sponsored doping in Russia, the IAAF suspended the country's athletes from competition, including the 2016 Summer Olympics.

I-League | Champions -- Successful clubs by seasons |  | The I-League, formerly known as National Football League, is one among the two co-existing premier football leagues in India together with Indian Super League. For sponsorship reasons, the league is officially known as the Hero I-League. It is currently contested by 11 clubs across the country. The competition was founded in 2007 as the successor to the National Football League (NFL) and competition commenced in November 2007. The league was launched as India's first ever professional football league and with the aim to increase the player pool for India's national team. Unlike the franchise based Indian Super League, the I-League operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the I-League 2nd Division. For the clubs that become I-League champions, they are granted the opportunity to participate in the AFC Cup, Asia's secondary international club competition. Since the inception of the I-League, a total of seven clubs have been crowned champions. Dempo have won the most titles in league history, being crowned champions three times. Churchill Brothers and former I-League side Bengaluru have won the league twice. Salgaocar, Mohun Bagan, Aizawl, Minerva Punjab, and the current champions, Chennai City have won it once.

List of colleges and universities in Vermont | Institutions | University of Vermont Middlebury College Castleton University | There are 18 currently operating colleges and universities based in the U.S. state of Vermont. This figure includes one research university, six master's universities, an art school, a culinary school, a law school, and a number of undergraduate associates and baccalaureate colleges. Four institutions chartered in other states offer degree programs at locations in Vermont. The state's largest school is its flagship public university, the University of Vermont. The other four public institutions are organized as the Vermont State Colleges system. The title of oldest college in Vermont is shared by three institutions. Middlebury College was chartered in 1800 and is Vermont's oldest operating college and the first institution to grant an academic degree (1802). Castleton University has its roots in successive institutions dating to 1787. The University of Vermont was chartered in 1791 but did not begin instruction until 1800 or grant a degree until 1804. Vermont's newest college not formed from existing institutions is Landmark College, founded in 1984 to serve students with learning disabilities; it is also the most expensive college in the United States. The smallest college in the state, with 187 students, is Sterling College, a work college focused on environmental studies. All of these schools are accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, except New England Culinary Institute, which is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology.

<context>
ADX Florence | Notable current inmates -- Foreign terrorists | This list contains foreign citizens who committed or attempted to commit terrorist attacks against United States citizens and interests . All sentences are without parole . | The United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum Facility (USP Florence ADMAX) is an American federal prison that provides a higher level of custody than a maximum security prison. It is classed as a supermax or control unit prison, where the safety of inmates and staff is paramount. It is located in unincorporated Fremont County, Colorado, near Florence, and opened in 1994, and it is informally known as the Alcatraz of the Rockies. The Federal Bureau of Prisons needed a unit designed specifically for the secure housing of those prisoners most capable of violence toward staff or other inmates. As of December 2019[update], there are 376 prisoners who spend 23 hours per day in single cells with facilities made of poured concrete to deter self-harm, and 24-hour supervision, carried out intensively with high staff-inmate ratios. Phones are generally banned and only limited broadcast entertainment is permitted. After three years in maximum confinement, some prisoners may be transferred to a less restrictive prison. The aim is to encourage reasonably peaceful behavior from the most violent career prisoners.

In the beginning, only countries within the Commonwealth could join. These members were then joined by India, New Zealand, and the West Indies in 1926 and later by Pakistan in 1953. In 1961, South Africa resigned due to their leaving the Commonwealth, but they continued to play Test cricket until their international exile in 1970. The Imperial Cricket Conference was renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, with new rules permitting countries from outside the Commonwealth to be elected into the governing body for the first time. That year, Fiji and the USA became the first Associate Member nations. In 1981, Sri Lanka became the first Associate Member to be elected a Full Member, returning the number of Test-playing nations to seven. In 1989, the ICC was again renamed, this time to International Cricket Council. South Africa was reelected as a Full Member to the ICC in 1991 and Zimbabwe was elected in 1992.

Bob White , USAF , first to exceed Mach 4 , 5 and 6 * Individual was killed in a work-related ( aviation ) accident . | The U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (TPS) graduated the following notable alumni who made significant contributions to the aerospace field. The school's mission is to produce experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators to lead and conduct test and evaluation of aerospace weapon systems. The school was established on September 9, 1944, as the Flight Test Training Unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. To take advantage of the uncongested skies and superb flying weather, the school was moved on February 4, 1951, to its present location at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of Southern California. Edwards AFB is the home of the Air Force Flight Test Center and has been an integral part of flight testing for over fifty years. Between 1962 and 1972, the Test Pilot School expanded its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots. Thirty-seven TPS graduates of this era were selected for the U.S. space program, and twenty-six went on to earn astronaut's wings by flying in the X-15, Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs. Although the school no longer trains astronauts, many TPS graduates since 1972 have been selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for duties in space. The school encourages applications from civilians, personnel from other U.S. military services, and individuals from foreign countries. An exchange program allows selected students to attend other test pilot schools including the United States Naval Test Pilot School, the United Kingdom's Empire Test Pilots' School, and France's EPNER.

Which non-hockey team did the player to wear 25 compete for ?
<context>
List of National Hockey League retired numbers | Honoured numbers | Unlike the numbers retired by the Flames , these honoured numbers were not necessarily withdrawn from circulation . Some of the numbers honoured by the Blues remain in circulation , while others have been removed from circulation without being officially retired . | This is a complete list of numbers retired by the National Hockey League (NHL). A retired number is a jersey number that is taken out of circulation by a team as a way of honouring a former member of that team who wore that number; after the number's retirement, members of that team are not permitted to wear the number on their jerseys unless by permission of the original number holder. The first team to retire a number was the Toronto Maple Leafs, which retired Ace Bailey's number 6 on February 14, 1934, prior to an All-Star game organized in his honour. The NHL currently has 128 retired numbers, 3 pending number retirements, 7 former retirements, and 23 honoured numbers. Most of the numbers retired by the Hartford Whalers and Quebec Nordiques were put back in circulation when those franchises relocated and became the Carolina Hurricanes and Colorado Avalanche
, respectively, although the Hurricanes keep Gordie Howe's number 9 unofficially retired. The Minnesota North Stars' two retired numbers were carried over when that franchise relocated to become the Dallas Stars, and remain retired today. The Arizona Coyotes had a policy of retaining the numbers retired when the franchise was the Winnipeg Jets but reversed it after the Phoenix Coyotes were sold and became the Arizona Coyotes. Honoured numbers are similar to retired numbers, except that they remain available for use by other players. Presently, only the Calgary Flames, and the St. Louis Blues employ this designation. The Philadelphia Flyers have also unofficially retired number 31 in honour of goaltender Pelle Lindbergh since his death in 1985. Wayne Gretzky's number 99 has been retired league-wide in 2000, although the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings separately retired Gretzky's number. Upon joining the league in 2000, the Minnesota Wild had a ceremony retiring number 1 from circulation as a tribute to their fans.

What is the original chapter of the brother born 24 April 1974 ?
<context>
List of Alpha Phi Alpha brothers |  |  | The list of Alpha Phi Alpha brothers (commonly referred to as Alphas) includes initiated and honorary members of Alpha Phi Alpha (ΑΦΑ), the first inter-collegiate Greek-letter organization established for Black college students. Founded in December 1905 as a literary society with the first presiding officer being CC Poindexter, it was established as a fraternity on December 4, 1906 at Ithaca, New York. Alpha Phi Alpha opened chapters at other colleges, universities, and cities, and named them with Greek letters. Members traditionally pledge into a chapter, although some members were granted honorary status prior to the fraternity's discontinuation of the practice of granting honorary membership. A chapter name ending in Lambda denotes an alumni chapter. The only alumni chapter that does not end in Lambda is Rho Chapter, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. No chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha is designated Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet that traditionally signifies the end. Deceased brothers are respectfully referred to as having their membership transferred to Omega Chapter, the fraternity's chapter of sweet rest. Frederick Douglass is distinguished as the only member initiated posthumously when he became an exalted honorary member of Omega chapter in 1921.

There are Intercity routes throughout Germany, and routes generally operate with a two-hour frequency, with multiple routes giving a more frequent service on core routes. Intercity services are operated by the DB Fernverkehr sector of Deutsche Bahn. The Intercity name was introduced in Germany in 1971, replacing the old F-Zug category, and was the top category of train in Germany until the introduction of the ICEs in the early 1990s. With the proliferation of ICE services, the role of IC trains has diminished slightly, and they have taken on the character of many former InterRegio trains. Nonetheless, Intercity trains still offer a very high standard of speed and comfort - all services convey first class accommodation, and most include catering - usually a Bistro Cafe, but some services include a restaurant. A number of Intercity services serve destinations outside Germany; most of these are under the EuroCity classification.

Which team did the 2013 recipient of the Walter Payton Award join in the tenth month of 2017 ?
<context>
Walter Payton Award | Winners |  | The Walter Payton Award is awarded annually to the most outstanding offensive player in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) of college football as chosen by a nationwide panel of media and college sports information directors. The honor was first given 33 years ago in 1987 to the outstanding player in the division, but in 1995, eligibility was restricted to offensive players, as the Buck Buchanan Award for defensive players was inaugurated. The award was named in honor of the late National Football League (NFL) legend Walter Payton, who starred at Jackson State University in the early 1970s. Among the many schools in the division, only nine have claimed more than one award, and only seven have had more than one player win the award. Eastern Washington and Villanova had three players win the award, and five have had two players win: Colgate, Georgia Southern, Idaho, New Hampshire, and Eastern Illinois. Two players have won the award twice, with both being the only players from their institutions to win. In 2009, Armanti Edwards from Appalachian State became the first to receive the award twice, followed in 2017 by Jeremiah Briscoe from Sam Houston State. The most recent winner, Trey Lance of North Dakota State in 2019, is the first freshman ever to receive the award.

List of counties in Colorado | Former counties | The sortable table below lists all the historic counties of the Territory of New Mexico , the Territory of Utah , the Territory of Kansas , and the extralegal Territory of Jefferson [ 20 ] that previously existed within the boundaries of the present State of Colorado , as well as the three defunct counties of the Territory of Colorado and the three defunct counties of the State of Colorado . The table includes the following information : | The U.S. state of Colorado is divided into 64 counties. Counties are important units of government in Colorado since there are no townships or other minor civil divisions. Two of these counties, Broomfield and Denver, have consolidated city and county governments. Colorado's ISO 3166-2:US state code is CO and its ANSI INCITS 38:2009 state code is 08. When the Colorado Territory first began creating counties in 1861, 17 counties (Summit, Larimer, Weld, Boulder, Gilpin, Clear Creek, Jefferson, Arapahoe, Douglas, Lake, Conejos, Costilla, Park, Fremont, El Paso, Pueblo, and Huerfano) and a Cheyenne Reserve were formed. In February 1866, the first new county, Las Animas, was created, followed by Saguache in December of that year. Bent County was created in February 1870, followed by Greenwood the following month. On February 2, 1874, Grand County and Elbert County were formed, and on February 10, La Plata, Hinsdale, and Rio Grande counties were created. Greenwood was absorbed into Bent on February 5. The last county to be created under the Colorado Territory name was San Juan County, created three months before statehood. By the time Colorado became a state on August 1, 1876, it had only 26 counties. In January 1877, Routt and Ouray were formed, followed by Gunnison and Custer counties in March.

List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II | S |  | This is a list of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II. The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States or an opposing foreign force. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict, the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Soviet invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. The United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time. For actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor. Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from Distinguished Service Crosses during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Douglas Albert Munro was the only serviceman from the United States Coast Guard in United States military history to receive the Medal for his actions during the war. The earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force rather than enemy since the United States was neutral during the events of December 7, 1941.

United States national rugby sevens team | Honors |  | The United States national rugby sevens team competes in international rugby sevens competitions. The main competition they play every year is the World Rugby Sevens Series, a series of ten tournaments played around the globe that includes the USA Sevens tournament in Las Vegas every spring. The team also participates in major tournaments every four years, such as the Summer Olympics, the Rugby World Cup Sevens, and the Pan American Games. The national sevens team is organized by USA Rugby, and the team has been led by Head Coach Mike Friday since 2014. The Eagles have been a core team in the World Series and finished in the top twelve each season since 2008-09. The Eagles' best season to date in the Sevens Series has been the 2018-19 where they finished second. The best result in a single Sevens tournament was winning the 2018 USA Sevens, 2019 USA Sevens and the 2015 London Sevens. In 2018 the Eagles won their first USA Sevens tournament at Sam Boyd stadium in Las Vegas. Successes in quadrennial events include winning bronze medals at the 2011 and 2015 Pan American Games, and winning the 2015 NACRA Sevens to clinch a spot in the 2016 Olympic Games. The United States traditionally used the sevens team to prepare players for the XV-side. Since January 2012, due to increased attention generated by rugby's return to the Olympics in 2016, the national sevens team has turned professional, with the team extending paid full-time contracts to its core players. The national sevens team has drawn a number of crossover athletes from American football and track, the most prominent examples being Perry Baker and Carlin Isles.

<context>
List of works by James Harrison | Works |  | James Harrison (1814-66) was an English architect who worked mainly in Chester, Cheshire. He worked mainly on churches - building new churches, rebuilding old churches, and making amendments and alterations to existing churches. Harrison also designed a number of houses in the Queen's Park area of Chester, and farm buildings on the Bolesworth estate. Harrison and Thomas Mainwaring Penson were the first architects to introduce buildings of the Black-and-white Revival to Chester in the 1850s. His rebuilding of God's Providence House in Watergate Street is described as the first conservation case in the modern sense.

<context>
List of Alpha Phi Alpha brothers |  |  | The list of Alpha Phi Alpha brothers (commonly referred to as Alphas) includes initiated and honorary members of Alpha Phi Alpha (ΑΦΑ), the first inter-collegiate Greek-letter organization established for Black college students. Founded in December 1905 as a literary society with the first presiding officer being CC Poindexter, it was established as a fraternity on December 4, 1906 at Ithaca, New York. Alpha Phi Alpha opened chapters at other colleges, universities, and cities, and named them with Greek letters. Members traditionally pledge into a chapter, although some members were granted honorary status prior to the fraternity's discontinuation of the practice of granting honorary membership. A chapter name ending in Lambda denotes an alumni chapter. The only alumni chapter that does not end in Lambda is Rho Chapter, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. No chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha is designated Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet that traditionally signifies the end. Deceased brothers are respectfully referred to as having their membership transferred to Omega Chapter, the fraternity's chapter of sweet rest. Frederick Douglass is distinguished as the only member initiated posthumously when he became an exalted honorary member of Omega chapter in 1921.

What is the population of the location that contains a tree on the list that is a registered natural monument of the country ?
<context>
List of oldest trees | Old trees with estimated ages |  | This is a list of the oldest-known trees, as reported in reliable sources. Definitions of what constitutes an individual tree vary. In addition, tree ages are derived from a variety of sources, including documented tree-ring count core samples, and from estimates. For these reasons, this article presents three lists of oldest trees, each using varying criteria. There are three tables of trees, which are listed by age and species. The first table includes trees for which a minimum age has been directly determined, either through counting or cross-referencing tree rings or through radiocarbon dating. Many of these trees may be even older than their listed ages, but the oldest wood in the tree has rotted away. For some old trees, so much of the centre is missing that their age cannot be directly determined. Instead, estimates are made based on the tree's size and presumed growth rate. The second table includes trees with these estimated ages. The last table lists clonal colonies in which no individual tree trunks may be remarkably old but in which the organism as a whole is thought to be very old. The current record-holders for individual, non-clonal trees are the Great Basin bristlecone pine trees from California and Nevada, in the United States.

List of Delta Sigma Theta chapters | Chapters Beginning With `` Gamma '' |  | Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. was founded on January 13, 1913 at Howard University, and began to expand its membership early on when it chartered Beta Chapter at Wilberforce University in 1914, Gamma Chapter at the University of Pennsylvania in 1918 and Delta Chapter at the University of Iowa in 1919. Delta Sigma Theta continues to Charter new chapters at both the Collegiate and Alumnae level. Individual Chapters are Chartered, not Founded, as only the Perpetual body was founded, and the founding occurred in 1913. Delta Sigma Theta has more than 940 Chapters located in the United States, England, Japan (Tokyo and Okinawa), Germany, the Virgin Islands, Liberia, Bermuda, Jamaica, The Bahamas, South Korea and Nigeria. The sorority's chapters are organized into seven regions and further sub-divided by state. While initially Alumnae / Graduate Chapters were named using the Greek Alphabet, the perpetual body of Delta Sigma Theta voted at the Twenty-Fourth National Convention, held in Detroit, Michigan on December 26-30, 1956, to abandon this practice. Following the vote, the Greek Letter names for the Alumnae Chapters are no longer in use or recognized by the Grand Chapter. Alumnae Chapters are instead named using their Geographic Location. This list includes Active, Inactive, Reassigned, and Retired undergraduate Chapters.

Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities | HEEACT World University Rankings ( Top 20 by subject ) -- Mechanical Engineering |  | The Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities or NTU Ranking is a ranking system of world universities by scientific paper volume, impact, and performance output. The ranking was originally published from 2007-2011 by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT) and has been published since 2012 by the National Taiwan University. It uses bibliometric methods to analyze and rank the scientific paper performance. In addition to the overall ranking, it includes a list of the top universities in six fields and fourteen subjects. The rankings were introduced in 2007. The original ranking methodology favored toward universities with medical schools. In 2008, HEEACT began publishing a Field Based Ranking including six fields: agriculture and environmental sciences (AGE), clinical medicine (MED), engineering, computing, and technology (ENG), life sciences (LIFE), natural sciences (SCI), and social sciences (SOC). In 2010, HEEACT began publishing subject rankings in fields of various field of science and technology. Science fields are divided into physics, chemistry, mathematics, and geosciences. Technology fields are split up into electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering (including energy and fuels), materials science, and civil engineering (including environmental engineering). HEEACT ended the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities Project in 2012. Due to disagreement about ranking results, the Taiwanese education authorities announced that the government would no longer support the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan to do this ranking.

How long ago did the Carian Age exist ?
<context>
Aetosaur | Classification -- Taxonomy |  | Aetosaurs (aetosaur /eɪˌɛtoʊˈsɔːr/; order name Aetosauria /eɪˌɛtoʊˈsɔːriə/; from Greek, ἀετός (aetos, eagle) and σαυρος (sauros, lizard)) are an extinct order of heavily armoured, medium- to large-sized Late Triassic herbivorous archosaurs. They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body covered by plate-like scutes. All aetosaurs belong to the family Stagonolepididae. Two distinct subdivisions of aetosaurs are currently recognized, Desmatosuchinae and Aetosaurinae, based primarily on differences in the morphology of the bony scutes of the two groups. Over 20 genera of aetosaurs have been described, and recently there has been controversy regarding the description of some of these genera. Aetosaur fossil remains are known from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their armoured plates are often preserved and are abundant in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, the presence of particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in. Aetosaur remains have been found since the early 19th century, although the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals.

2010 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships | Women 's race -- Women 's results | Peninah Arusei ( pictured in 2007 ) won a bronze medal to help Kenya to the team gold . Japan 's Yoshimi Ozaki ( shown running in the 2009 World Championship Marathon ) led her team to a sixth consecutive team medal . | The 2010 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships was held in Nanning, China on 16 October 2010. The competition took place on the city streets, beginning and ending at Wuxiang Square, with a total prize purse of US$245,000 at stake. The Kenyan athletes emerged with both the individual and team titles in the men's and women's races. Despite limited experience in top level half marathon races, Wilson Kiprop and Florence Kiplagat won their respective races. Kiprop broke Zersenay Tadese's winning streak which dated back to 2006, out-sprinting the defending champion in the final stages. Sammy Kitwara won the men's bronze medal and helped Kenya to the men's team title. Led by Zersenay, the Eritrean men beat Ethiopia to the team silver medal spot. Kiplagat, who was ever present at the front of the women's race, outdid Ethiopian Dire Tune in the last kilometre to win her second gold medal on the global stage. Mirroring Kitwara, Kenya's women's bronze medallist Peninah Jerop Arusei secured the team's victory over Ethiopia. Representing the hosts, Zhu Xiaolin was the only non-African to reach the top eight at the championships. The joint effort of the Japanese women aided them to a sixth consecutive team bronze medal - making them the only medalling country outside the typically strong African triumvirate of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea. A total of 30 countries were represented at the 19th edition of the competition and 123 runners altogether were entered into the men's and women's races.

List of FC Barcelona records and statistics | Players records -- Top goalscorers | As of match played 30 January 2020 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] | Futbol Club Barcelona is a professional football club, based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto Més que un club (More than a club). The official Barça anthem is the Cant del Barça, written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the world's second richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €495 million in 2011-12 season. Barcelona played its first friendly match on 8 December 1899 against the English colony in Barcelona in the old velodrome in Bonanova. Initially, Barcelona played against other local clubs in various Catalan tournaments. In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first truly national league, and has since achieved the distinction of being one of only three clubs to have never been relegated, along with Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. Barcelona is the only European club to have played continental football every season since 1955. Barcelona holds a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, with matches between the two teams referred to as El Clásico (El Clàssic in Catalan). Matches against city rivals Espanyol are known as the Derbi barceloní. Barcelona has amassed various records since its founding.

Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation | Residential landmarks and farmsteads |  | Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation is a non-profit educational institution in Washington, Pennsylvania. Its purpose is to encourage and assist the preservation of historic structures in Washington County, Pennsylvania. The foundation operates its own landmark certification process, as well as working with the National Park Service to document and place landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places. It also offers advice and assistance for historic building owners who wish to preserve their facilities. Since its inception, the foundation has been successful in helping many historic building owners in the preservation of their structures. For a number of years, the foundation has been in conflict with Washington & Jefferson College. In 1968, the college's campus master plan called for the expansion of the campus eastward towards Wade Avenue in East Washington Borough, a plan that placed them in conflict with the residents of that area. For the next 30 years, the college maintained a policy of purchasing any homes in that area as they became available. In response, the Washington County History and Landmarks Foundation was able to get the East Washington Historic District, a collection of 120 Victorian homes in that area, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The college opposed the designation but did not object in time to prevent it. According to College President Howard J. Burnett, the district was structured to prevent expansion of the college. In the 1990s, the hard feelings between some residents and the College came to a head, with residents trying to have the Borough enact anti-demolition laws to block expansion and a meeting of the Washington County History and Landmarks Foundation deteriorated into a shouting match between residents and college officials.

<context>
Black Hill transmitting station | Digital television |  | The Black Hill transmitting station is a facility for FM and TV broadcasting at Black Hill (grid reference NS828647), on Duntilland Road, Salsburgh, North Lanarkshire, Scotland which is near the town of Airdrie. It has a guyed mast 306.6 m (1,006 ft) tall, bringing the antennas to a height of 540 m (1,770 ft) above sea level. It was built, by the Independent Television Authority (ITA), in 1957 and is now owned and operated by Arqiva. The present mast is the second to have been built at the site. The first, built in 1957 brought the Independent Television service to Central Scotland and opened for service on 31 August 1957. However, complex anomalies in the behaviour of the antenna caused its performance to be less than predicted, and the decision was taken in 1959 to replace the mast with a higher structure and a more conventional aerial on the outside of the mast rather than inside as had been the case with the first mast. The original 750 foot mast was then dismantled and later used at the Selkirk transmitting station in the Borders where it still stands. The transmitter was originally a B group but with the advent of Digital two of the 6 muxes then went out of band and required an E group (or wideband) aerial if reception of these was required. At DSO in 2011 it returned to the B group though with the eventual addition of MUXES 7 and 8 it technically became a K group. At Blackhill's 700MHz clearance in Sept 2018 it more or less returned to the B group, but, because its output has (since DSO) been fairly close to the B group at all times a B, K or E group (or a wideband) aerial would work for most areas (see graph). Black Hill has the fifth greatest population coverage with a figure of around 2.5 million. Between 1961 and the end of the 405 line ITV service in 1985, the Black Hill aerial had the highest effective radiated power of any transmitter in the ITV network with 475 kW radiated towards Dundee.

The Chinese Super League was created by the rebranding of the former top division Chinese Football Association Jia-A League in 2004 (see Chinese Jia-A League, not to be confused with Chinese Football Association Jia League, which is the current second tier league). Originally contested by 12 teams in its inaugural year, the league has since expanded, with 16 teams competing in the current season. A total of 31 teams have competed in the CSL since its inception. Only seven teams of them have won the title: Guangzhou Evergrande (8), 
Shandong Luneng (3), Beijing Guoan (1), Shanghai SIPG (1), Shenzhen Jianlibao (1), Dalian Shide (1), Changchun Yatai (1). The current Super League champions are Guangzhou Evergrande. The Chinese Super League is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in China, with an average attendance of 24,107 for league matches in the 2018 season. This is the twelfth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the sixth-highest of any professional association football league in the world, behind Bundesliga, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Liga MX. The League is now running under the authorization of the Chinese Football Association, The CSL Company, which is currently the commercial branch of the League, is a corporation in which the CFA and all of the member clubs act as shareholders. It is planned that the CFA will ultimately transfer their shares of The CSL Company to the clubs and professional union which consists of CSL clubs will be established as the League's management entity.
